## FAQ

#### Will this work on any raspberry pi?

No only the pico:
pico 
pico h
pico wh
pico w

#### Dose this work on the pico zero 2

i dont know really i have been trying to get a pico zero 2 but cant, if it works please be free to tell me 


#### Do the scripts need leds and buttons ect?

Depends which script but some might some might not 
## How to use

This scripts are made in micro python, latest as of 5/5/2023
I would use thonny, first upload the script you would like to the pico open the script and press run or f5 and if the script uses led or sensors add them accordingly
